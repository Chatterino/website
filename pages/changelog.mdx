# Chatterino Changelog

## 2.3

- Added "Channel Filters". See https://wiki.chatterino.com/Filters/ for more information. (#1748, #2083, #2090, #2200, #2225)
- Added Streamer Mode configuration (under `Settings -> General`), where you can select which features of Chatterino should behave differently when you are in Streamer Mode. (#2001, #2316, #2342, #2376)
- Color mentions to match the mentioned users. You can disable this by unchecking "Color @usernames" under `Settings → General → Advanced`. (#1963, #2284)
- Added support for tabbing bit emotes - the ones you unlock after cheering to a streamer. (#2550)

- Commands

  - Added `/clip` command, `Alt+X` keybind or `Create a clip` option in split header's context menu. This requires a new authentication scope so re-authentication will be required to use it. (#2271, #2377, #2528)
  - Added `/block` and `/unblock` aliases for the `/ignore` and `/unignore` commands. (#2370)
  - Added `/clearmessages` command - does what "Burger menu -> More -> Clear messages" does. (#2485)
  - Added `/marker` command - similar to webchat, it creates a stream marker. (#2360)
  - Added `/chatters` command showing chatter count. (#2344)
  - Added `/streamlink` command. Usage: `/streamlink <channel>`. You can also use the command without arguments in any twitch channel to open it in streamlink. (#2443, #2495)
