In fast chats, you might not notice that your message was successfully sent.
Chatterino can now pulse the text input when your messages have been received
in chat. You can enable this feature by enabling the "Pulse text input when
one of your messages is successfully sent" setting.

### Logging {#2.5.4-logging}

<div className="changelog-entry">

The timestamp used in the logs is now customizable, similar to the one used in the app itself.

<Credit author="droidicus" helper="Nerixyz, pajlada" prs="6338" />

Logs can now use the timestamp of messages provided by Twitch instead of the
local one. This behaviour is disabled by default.

</div>

### Image Uploader {#2.5.4-image-uploader}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Chatterino can now export and import the image uploader configuration to/from the clipboard.

  helpers="pajlada, Nerixyz"
  prs="6284, 6387, 6394"
/>

For image upload services that serve the response in an array, the JSON selector can now query arrays using their indices like `foo.0`.

<Credit author="Nerixyz" prs="6193" />

</div>

### UI {#2.5.4-ui}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Various buttons now use vector icons over the old rasterized ones. This makes them appear sharp at any scale.

</div>

### Plugins {#2.5.4-plugins}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Through `c2.WebSocket`, plugins can now open WebSocket connections. This can be used to listen to events from third party services.

<Credit
  author="Nerixyz"
  helper="Mm2PL, pajlada"
  prs="6076, 6141, 6186, 6314, 6315"
/>

Plugins can now create styled messages through `c2.Message.new()`.
Previously, only system (gray) messages could be created.
Compared to C++, there are a few capabilities missing&mdash;namely emotes and images.
These will be added in future releases along with an API to inspect and alter existing messages (e.g. in filters).

<Credit author="Nerixyz" helper="Mm2PL, pajlada" prs="5754" />

For plugin developers, there is a new REPL (read-eval-print-loop) window similar to the browser console.
It displays log messages and allows you to evaluate Lua code in the context of the plugin.
You have to manually enable this in your [`settings.json`](https://wiki.chatterino.com/Settings/) where you have to set `plugins.repl.enabled` to `true` and restart. Then you can open the REPL from the plugin settings.

### Crash fixes {#2.5.4-crash-fixes}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Fixes various crashes that could occur when:

- shutting down Chatterino (either at the wrong time, or just at all)
- running Chatterino attached to a conhost that was closed before Chatterino
- EventSub had connection issues
- searching in an emote popup that was started from a non-Twitch channel
- plugins would make an HTTP request from a timeout handler

  author="Nerixyz" prs="6373" inline />

## 2.5.3 (Released 2025-03-23) {#2.5.3}

### Twitch EventSub support {#2.5.3-eventsub}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Twitch is shutting down the old API we used to get moderation events & channel
point events from. In this release we've updated to Twitch's new API
["EventSub"](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/).

This change has one known drawback:

- Channel point redemptions might not render correctly. There's a feature
  request on [Twitch's
  UserVoice](https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310213-developers/suggestions/43371027-allow-getting-realtime-updates-on-polls-prediction)
  that you can upvote if you'd like to see this feature return.

To support the new API we've had to request some more scopes when you log in
with your account. You will be prompted to log in again on startup if you're missing any
required scopes.

If you run into any issues with this, please let us know on our <a
href={discord}>Discord</a>, or make a bug report on our <a
href={github}>GitHub</a>.

### Crash fixes {#2.5.3-crash-fixes}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Fixes various crashes that could occur when:

- making a Lua HTTP request from a coroutine
- clicking the "Install" button for an update on Linux or macOS
- closing down Chatterino
- trying to search in an uninitialized split

<Credit author="Mm2PL, pajlada" prs="5800, 5818, 6018, 6057" />

</div>

### Windows shortcut {#2.5.3-windows-shortcut}

<div className="changelog-entry">

We've made some changes to the shortcut on Windows - this means that you might
have to recreate the shortcut pointing to Chatterino in your start menu or
task bar.
This change was necessary to ensure desktop notifications can fetch the
correct application information when they're being displayed.

<Credit author="8thony" prs="5975" />

</div>

### Join order {#2.5.3-join-order}

<div className="changelog-entry">

If you have a lot of channels open, you might have noticed that Chatterino can
be slow at joining some of them.
We now prioritize joining the channels that are in your active tab, reducing the time-to-type-a-message by anywhere from 0 seconds to 60 seconds!

<Credit author="Nerixyz" prs="5850" />

</div>

### Monospaced timestamps {#2.5.3-monospaced-timestamps}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Some fonts don't include monospaced numbers - with Chatterino 2.5.3 even fonts
without monospaced numbers will render timestamps as if they were.

### Linux desktop notifications {#2.5.3-linux-desktop-notifications}

<div className="changelog-entry">

We now support desktop notifications on Linux using
[libnotify](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libnotify). This requires
you to be running a desktop notification daemon. You probably already have one
installed, if not you can install and run [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/).

### Improved support for new Twitch features {#2.5.2-twitch-features}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Messages using the **Message Effects** or **Gigantify an Emote** power-up
feature are now highlighted. We don't actually show any message effects, nor do we gigantify the emote, but you can pretend the emote is bigger now that you know it's meant to be gigantified.

Messages from Shared Chats now indicate which channel it was sent in.

We've provided better control of some AutoMod features. You can control whether or not to show AutoMod messages that were blocked due to a blocked term. By default, no blocked terms will be visible if you have streamer mode enabled.

### Added Twitch moderation features {#2.5.2-twitch-moderation}

<div className="changelog-entry">

If you use the inline moderation buttons, you can now upload custom icons for those buttons. This can be especially useful when you have a lot of them.

To add an icon to a moderation action, click Moderation in the Settings dialog, go to the Moderation buttons tab, and double-click the icon cell next to your action.

The `/ban`, `/timeout`, `/unban`, `/untimeout` commands now accept multiple channels if you want to easier wipe out cross-channel shenanigans.

Examples:

- Ban user in the chat you have selected: `/ban forsen`
- Ban user in a specific chat: `/ban --channel pajlada forsen`
- Ban user in two chat: `/ban --channel pajlada --channel nymn forsen`

Example command:

- Ban the user you right-clicked in the current channel + another channel: `/ban --channel {channel.name} --channel nymn {user.name}`

Example moderation button action:

- Ban the user in the current channel + another channel: `/ban --channel {channel.name} --channel nymn {user.name}`

### User Card Pronouns {#2.5.2-pronouns}

<div className="changelog-entry">

You can now show a user's pronoun from [pr.alejo.io](https://pr.alejo.io) in their User Card.

This feature can be enabled with the `Show user's pronouns in user card` setting.

### Improved tab unread indicators {#2.5.2-tab-indicators}

<div className="changelog-entry">

If you have the same channel open in multiple tabs, "reading" the message in one tab marks the other tabs as unread.

<Credit author="hemirt" helper="nerixyz, pajlada" />

</div>

### Plugins alpha release {#2.5.2-plugins}

<div className="changelog-entry">

We are testing a plugin system in Chatterino. Plugins are disabled by default.
To enable them, open the settings, go to `Plugins` and check the `Enable
plugins` checkbox.

Plugin documentation can be found in [the Chatterino2 repo](https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/blob/master/docs/wip-plugins.md).

The plugin system uses Lua with [sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) by [ThePhD](https://github.com/ThePhD).

Got any ideas for what you'd like to be able to create with Plugins? Let us
know in [this discussion.](https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/discussions/4999)

Have you started playing around with plugins and feel like something is
missing, or something is unergonomic? [Start a new discussion.](https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/discussions/new?category=ideas)

discussion.](https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/discussions/new?category=q-a)

### Improved high-DPI support on Windows {#2.5.2-high-dpi}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Text, buttons, windows should now better respect your Windows display scale setting. If you've previously increased your font size & Chatterino2 scale then you might need to re-adjust them with this release.

<Credit author="nerixyz" />

</div>

### Duplicating tabs {#2.5.2-duplicate-tabs}

<div className="changelog-entry">

You can now duplicate tabs by right-clicking the tab and clicking "Duplicate
Tab".

</div>

### Modified tab visibility control {#2.5.2-tab-visibility}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Tab visibility control is now more verbose but hopefully easier to understand when right-clicking the tab bar.

This removes the default Ctrl+Shift+L hotkey which was used for toggling the "live only" tab visibility state. With there being more than two states, this caused more confusion than it helped.

Custom hotkeys can still be added to swap to various tab visibility modes.

</div>

### Improved error handling for Twitch API requests {#2.5.2-twitch-api-errors}

<div className="changelog-entry">

When using the `/settitle` and `/setgame` commands you're now told what's actually wrong.

<Credit author="JakeRYW" />

</div>

### Updated browser list for "Open links in private mode" feature {#2.5.2-private-mode-browsers}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Added Brave, google-chrome-stable, firefox-devedition,
firefox-developer-edition, firefox-beta, and firefox-nightly as
supported browsers.

<Credit author="Niller2005, teknsl" />

</div>

### Settings improvements {#2.5.2-settings-improvements}

<div className="changelog-entry">

- Dragging & dropping now shows a line indicator instead of rectangle while reordering entries in tables.
- Added some search tags for settings so it's easier to find them using search (e.g. "bttv" and "ffz" show all the BetterTTV and FrankerFaceZ settings.)

<Credit author="nerixyz, pajlada" />

</div>

### Improved link handling {#2.5.2-link-parsing}

<div className="changelog-entry">

Prefixes and suffixes like parentheses around links are now recognized, and domain names are now checked, resulting in less false-positives.

<Credit author="nerixyz" />

</div>

### Helix API emote loading {#2.5.2-helix-emotes}

<div className="changelog-entry">

We now use Twitch's Helix API to load the list of emotes you can post. This means we can now see most emotes you have access to, including event emotes.

### Nerdier things {#2.5.2-nerd-things}

<div className="changelog-entry">

This release will be the last release of Chatterino2 that supports Qt5, meaning Windows 7 will disappear. Please update your Windows system if you're still on Windows 7.

The IRC beta feature has been removed.

A huge effort has been taken to refactor our message building process, adding a bunch of tests to them to ensuring it will take a lot more effort for us to break message building going forward. - Authored by @nerixyz with help from @pajlada

## 2.4.6 (Released 2023-09-30)

This is a **security release** and currently **only available on Windows**. This release also **drops support for Windows 7 and Windows 8** since we are required to update our dependencies which do not work with unsupported Windows releases anymore.

<br />

This change brings a few less tested consequences, such as emote order being
a bit different and some UI changes. These are being worked on for the next
release.

- Bugfix: Fix a [security issue when loading webp image files](https://www.qt.io/blog/two-qt-security-advisorys-gdi-font-engine-webp-image-format). To achieve this, Qt was updated from 5.15 to 6.5. (#4844)
